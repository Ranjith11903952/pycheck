# Sensitive Data Scanner 🔍

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7+-blue.svg)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

A security tool to scan your codebase for accidentally committed secrets, API keys, and other sensitive data with automatic fixing capability.

## Features ✨

- 🔎 Scans multiple file types (Python, JavaScript, Java, PHP, config files, etc.)
- 🎨 Color-coded output for easy issue identification
- 📝 Automatic commenting of sensitive lines (with user confirmation)
- 🚀 Multi-language support with appropriate comment syntax
- 📊 Progress tracking with visual progress bar
- 🔄 Handles different file encodings (UTF-8 and fallback to Latin-1)

## Supported File Types 📂

- Python files (`*.py`)
- JavaScript files (`*.js`)
- Java files (`*.java`)
- PHP files (`*.php`)
- Configuration files (`.env`, `config.*`, `settings.*`, etc.)
- YAML/JSON/XML files
- And more!

## Installation ⚙️

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sensitive-data-scanner.git
   cd sensitive-data-scanner
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage 🚀

Basic scan:
```bash
python scanner.py /path/to/your/project
```

Verbose mode (shows errors):
```bash
python scanner.py /path/to/your/project --verbose
```

### Command Line Options
| Option      | Description                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `--verbose` | Show detailed progress and errors    |

## How It Works ⚙️

The scanner checks for these patterns (case insensitive):
- API keys (`API_KEY`, `APIKEY`)
- Secret keys (`SECRET_KEY`, `SECRETKEY`)
- Access keys (`ACCESS_KEY`, `ACCESSKEY`)
- Tokens (`TOKEN`)
- Passwords (`PASSWORD`)
- Credentials (`CREDENTIALS`)

When issues are found:
1. The tool displays them with file locations
2. Asks if you want to automatically comment them out
3. If confirmed, modifies files with appropriate comments:
   - `#` for Python/Shell scripts
   - `//` for Java/C/C++
   - `<!-- -->` for HTML/XML
   - Defaults to `#` for other files
